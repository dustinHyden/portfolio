## Welcome

Looks like you've stumbled across my space on the web, nice to meet you! I'm Dustin Hyden, a Barrie Web Developer & Designer. I won't say much here, just browse to your hearts content through the files, and enjoy.

Cheers,

## Notes

- This project is built using NextJS 13 (beta)
- The deployment is hosted using Vercel
- The [data](app/data) folder contains all of my project data (a faux database)
- The [3d](app/3d) folder contains all of the neat 3d effects
- NextJ3 [(pages)](<app/(pages)>) contain all of my routes
