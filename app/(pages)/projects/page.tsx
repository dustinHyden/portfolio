        Welcome to my longer list of client projects. I'd have recommended
        scrolling through the homepage for the fancy 3d effect, but since you're
        here you get to enjoy a more traditional layout.

          I've got more projects, but if you've scrolled this far I think we
          should just have a call and discuss your next project together.
