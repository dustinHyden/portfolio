          is a new live entertainment company located in Barrie, Ontario. We
          were tasked with helping determine the brand strategy and creating the
          visual identity of the brand.
        </p>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          Following our process, we started with a discovery session, determined
          their competitors, and found a niche for LiveBarrie to focus on: big,
          bold, and trustworthy.{" "}

        <h3>Logo variations</h3>
        <p>
          We knew right away that LiveBarrieâ€™s logo will need a few variations.
          Many of LiveBarrieâ€™s promotional materials are very tall and narrow
          (such as a poster). Thus we designed a logo specifically for this use
          case.

        <h3>Brand colours</h3>
        <p>
          Since LiveBarrieâ€™s branding will appear alongside various acts, we
          needed to choose colours that can can compliment a wide variety of
          colour palettes.

        <h3>A guide created</h3>
        <p>
          Now that LiveBarrie has a complete brand kit, any designer will be
          able to look at this kit and design promotional materials that match
          LiveBarrieâ€™s look and feel. This reduces reduces the time it takes to
          teach new designers about the brand, resulting in cost savings for
          LiveBarrie, while also developing a visually consistent identity.
        </p>
        <h3>The future</h3>
        <p>
          Our relationship with LiveBarrie continues to progress. Our next
          project is working on a website that allows them to showcase their
          upcoming events.
