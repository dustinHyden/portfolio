        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.jeriroberts.com/" target="_blank">
            LiveBarrie
          </a>{" "}
          is a new live entertainment company located in Barrie, Ontario. I was
          tasked with helping determine the brand strategy and creating the
          visual identity of the brand.
        </p>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          Following my standard process, I started with a discovery session,
          determined their competitors, and found a niche for LiveBarrie to
          focus on: big, bold, and trustworthy.{" "}

        <h3>Logo variations</h3>
        <p>
          I knew right away that LiveBarrie&apos;s logo will need a few
          variations. Many of LiveBarrie&apos;s promotional materials are very
          tall and narrow (such as a poster). Thus, I designed a logo
          specifically for this use case.

        <h3>Brand colours</h3>
        <p>
          Since LiveBarrie&apos;s branding will appear alongside various acts, I
          needed to choose colours that can can compliment a wide variety of
          colour palettes.

        <h3>A guide created</h3>
        <p>
          Now that LiveBarrie has a complete brand kit, any designer will be
          able to look at this kit and design promotional materials that match
          LiveBarrie&apos;s look and feel. This reduces reduces the time it
          takes to teach new designers about the brand, resulting in cost
          savings for LiveBarrie, while also developing a visually consistent
          identity.
        </p>
        <h3>The future</h3>
        <p>
          Our relationship with LiveBarrie continues to progress. We have since
          worked together to develop their website and I now design all of their
          posters/promotional material for their events.
