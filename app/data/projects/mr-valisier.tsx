          is located in Montreal, Canada. They‚Äôre known for providing high
          quality suitcases and other luggage accessories. After several years
          with their website they wanted a refresh.

        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          Mr. Valisier reached out to us after seeing another project of ours:{" "}
          <Link href="/projects/suniela">Suniela</Link>. They wanted a website
          that had a similar attention to detail, while creating a very
          professional brand in the process. Ecommerce projects are always chalk
          full of features. From the custom vertical picture gallery on the
          product page, to the animated luggage icons on the bottom of the
          homepage. Here‚Äôs a few below.

        <h3>A unique side tab</h3>
        <p>
          On the left-hand side of the site, we added a button called ‚Äúnew‚Äù that
          would allow for users to immediately see what products have recently
          been added to the site. It‚Äôs a unique bit of functionality that we
          haven‚Äôt seen often but really love the value it brings.

        <h3>Simple, yet elegant collections pages</h3>
        <p>
          Mr. Valisier has a lot of different collections, from backpacks to
          bags, accessories and more. Thus, we needed to make sure that the
          collections page template was visually familiar and easy to navigate.
