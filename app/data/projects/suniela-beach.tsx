        <h3>Rounded edges everywhere</h3>
        <p>
          Suniela‚Äôs portable cabanas all have one thing in common, they are half
          circles. Their shape is very distinguishable and helps them stand out.
          To create a visual identity that matched this, we made the majority of
          the site incorporate these arches. In fact, all the angles used come
          straight from their logo, this helped to make the site match the rest
          of Suniela‚Äôs incredible branding.
        </p>
        <h3>Colour without the palm trees</h3>
        <p>
          Suniela stressed the importance of creating a colorful and vibrant
          website that stayed away from palm tree clip art. Most competitors
          immediately use palm trees as a part of branding, as it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to
          do. Instead, we focused on more abstract shapes, that match the arch
          of the product.
        </p>
        <h3>Quick view</h3>
        <p>
          Suniela products come in a wide assortment of colour variations. We
          wanted to illustrate this by allowing the user to hover over the
          different colours before viewing the full product, so that they can
          see ahead of time what colours Suniela has to offer.

        <h3>Simple dropdowns.</h3>
        <p>
          Suniela products require a lot of information to explain the benefits
          and differentiating factors. To help make this easier, we implemented
          a very minimal dropdown system to sort the more generic information.

        <h3>Even more</h3>
        <p>
          Suniela can now customize each product page to be entirely unique,
          with an endless amount of customization options, but that doesn‚Äôt even
          begin to cover all the unique features we packed in this project. If
          you like what you see and you want us to help with your next website
          let us know and we can discuss even more of the features we built into
          this project.
