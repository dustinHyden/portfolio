          is an award winning interior decoration company. They have been
          featured in numerous magazines and publications, including HGTV.
          MANOR12 provides personalized guidance for homeowners who are ready
          for a change.

        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          I was tasked with creating a fully custom WordPress website, one that
          would focus on the photography to tell a story. It needed to be clean,
          modern, and showcase all of MANOR12&apos;s talents.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/mind-your-manor-homepage.mp4" />
        <h3>It&apos;s All About Photography</h3>
        <p>
          I knew from the very beginning that the website needed to focus solely
          on product photography. Being too busy or cluttered would detract from
          what makes MANOR12 so special ‚Äì their ability to design and stage
          rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you can&apos;t just throw a few pictures on a page and hope
          it looks good. It takes planning, and a lot of creativity. By creating a
          really neat effect, I call it the looking glass effect, I was able to
          make each and every photo feel like it was alive, and as if you were
          peering into a world of wonder and intrigue. Whenever the user scrolls
          through the page, the images will reveal more of themselves,
          almost like a looking glass peering into the photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          This effect was achieved by the photo slides through a mask, giving the user a spotlight on
          the image, and as the user scrolls, the spotlight moves with them. See the video below to see 
          this custom generated effect in action.

          height={800}
          alt="Master bedroom."
        />
        <h3>Pop-up Gallery</h3>
        <p>
          Each of these images can be opened in a focused modal view. This really drives home the idea that the
          photos are what the viewer is meant to spend their time and attention on.
        </p>

        <h3>Page Transitions</h3>
        <p>
          As a viewer travels the website, I wanted the pages to transition
          beyond just going to white like a traditional website. Instead, I
          wanted to unify the page transition design with the same functionality
          as MANOR12&apos;s navigation menu dropdown. This required me to code
          the entire website as just one page (and implement a whole bunch of
          neat server and client side effects) but the end result was worth it.
          Check it out below.

        <h3>Speaking of the Navigation‚Ä¶</h3>
        <p>
          A good user experience is everything. Before I even begin coding or
          designing the page, I sit down and determine how I want the user to
          traverse the site. Do I want them to see the most important links or
          click a hamburger menu, or both? Do I want to entice the user to
          scroll down, or focus on a specific piece of content? For MANOR12, we
          wanted to make sure that a user could always find their way around the
          site. To do this, I created a sticky hamburger menu, along with a
          search icon. Check out how I utilized these in the video below.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          MANOR12 now has a website that is truly unique. From the subtle
          animations to the sliding photo effect, I love this project so much,
          and MANOR12&apos;s viewers do as well. This website was an amazing
          project to be working on. I appreciate{" "}
