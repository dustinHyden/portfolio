          is an award winning interior decoration company. They have been
          featured in numerous magazines and publications, including HGTV.
          MANOR12 provides personalized guidance for homeowners who are ready
          for a change.

        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          I was tasked with creating a fully custom WordPress website, one that
          would focus on the photography to tell a story. It needed to be clean,
          modern, and showcase all of MANOR12‚Äôs talents.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/mind-your-manor-homepage.mp4" />
        <h3>It‚Äôs all about the photography</h3>
        <p>
          I knew from the very beginning that the website needed to focus solely
          on product photography. Being too busy or cluttered would detract from
          what makes MANOR12 so special ‚Äì their ability to design and stage
          rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you can‚Äôt just throw a few pictures on a page and hope it
          looks good. It takes planning, and a lot of creativity. By adding a
          really neat effect, I call it the looking glass effect, I was able to
          make each and every photo feel like it was alive, and as if you were
          peering into a world of wonder and intrigue. Whenever the user scrolls
          through the page, the images will actually reveal more of themselves,
          almost like a looking glass peering into the photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn‚Äôt make it so more of the image just‚Ä¶ appears. That would be too
          easy! Not to mention, not as visually stunning. Instead, the photo
          slides through a mask, giving the user a sort of spotlight on the
          image, and based on how much they scroll, the spotlight moves.
        </p>
        <h3>The looking glass effect</h3>
        <p>
          When a viewer scrolls through the page, more of the image will come
          into frame, but not in the traditional manner. Instead, the user is
          given a window into the image. See the video below to see this effect
          in action.

          width={1000}
          height={800}
          alt="Master bedroom."
        />
        <h3>Pop-up gallery, to really focus on the photography</h3>
        <p>
          I implemented the ability for the viewers to click on images and see
          them in a focused mode. This really drives home the idea that the
          photos are what the viewer is meant to spend their time and attention
          on.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/manor12-gallery.mp4" />
        <h3>Page transitions</h3>
        <p>
          When a viewer traverses the website, I wanted the pages to transition
          beyond just going to white like a traditional website. Instead, I
          wanted to unify the page transition design with the same functionality
          as MANOR12‚Äôs navigation menu dropdown. This required me to code the
          entire website as just one page (and implement a whole bunch of neat
          server and client side effects) but the end result was worth it. Check
          it out below.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/manor12-page-transitions.mp4" />
        <h3>Speaking of the navigation‚Ä¶</h3>
        <p>
          A good user experience is everything. Before I even begin coding or
          designing the page, I sit down and determine how i want the user to
          traverse the site. Do I want them to see the most important links or
          click a hamburger menu, or both? Do I want to entice the user to
          scroll down, or focus on a specific piece of content? For MANOR12, we
          wanted to make sure that a user could always find their way around the
          site. To do this, I created a sticky hamburger menu, along with a
          search icon. Check out how I utilized these in the video below.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          MANOR12 now has a website that is truly unique. From the subtle
          animations to the sliding photo effect, I love this project so much,
          and MANOR12‚Äôs viewers do as well. This project was an amazing project
          to be working on. I appreciate{" "}
