            Bee By The Sea Natural Products
          </a>{" "}
          was founded in 2008 by Andrew Wingrove with the chance discovery of
          the sea buckthorn berry while travelling abroad. After extensive
          research and development, Bee launched a cream unlike anything else on
          the market. Fast forward 12 years and they are still producing that
          same bestselling body cream. They‚Äôve expanded their offerings to
          include a whole assortment of healthy products. Best of all,
          everything is produced and packaged in Ontario.
        </p>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          Bee needed a new website. Well actually, they needed two-in-one. Their
          business has two major segments: end consumers, and wholesale users.
          To better serve both segments, Bee was looking for a way to have their
          website look and feel different based on what user was logged in. Or
          to put it another way, they needed a way for their wholesale customers
          to have a different experience from end consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This meant we needed to build two websites disguised as one! The goal
          was to give Bee the flexibility of using one platform to better serve
          their customers and also make their own lives a tad easier.
        </p>

        <h3>Reducing the number of clicks required</h3>
        <p>
          Bee stressed the importance of reducing the number of clicks it takes
          for a viewer to get to where they want to go. To do this, we focused
          on the navigation. When on a computer, the viewer can mouse over any
          of the dropdowns along the top to be greeted with a very unique drop
          down effect. On mobile, we implemented the ability to view the
          dropdown information with the use of tabs. See the video and picture
          below to see this in action.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/bee-nav.mp4" />
        <p>
          Before the new website, users did not have the ability to filter
          through products within the navigation. This filter greatly reduces
          the number of pages they need to go through to find the product they
          want.

        <h3>Grid-style promotional blocks</h3>
        <p>
          Promoting your products on your own website is a huge key to success
          for any ecommerce business. We decided to create two types of
          promotional blocks that Bee can place anywhere on their site. The
          first is a single, full page promotion, the second is a 3 card block
          promoting 3 different options. Check this out in action below.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/bee-feature-cards.mp4" />
        <h3>Full page search</h3>
        <p>
          If the user cannot find what they are looking for using the extensive
          drop down navigation, they can use the site wide search option
          instead. This search menu is a full page option, as can be seen in the
          video below.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/bee-search.mp4" />
        <h3>Rewards</h3>
        <p>
          Bee wanted to include the rewards program information in a manner that
          was easier to digest. To do so, we fixed a button to the bottom left
          of every page which opens up a rewards panel with customizable
          information. Viewers can now easily see how many reward points they
          have, along with how to earn more.
        </p>
        <Video src="/videos/bee-rewards.mp4" />
        <h3>Contact options</h3>
        <p>
          Bee recently opened a physical store, and as such, needed a way for
          viewers to easily get directions to this new location. We implemented
          an option for viewers to click the map that will automatically open
          Google Maps.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also made the contact information stick on the left side of the
          screen to always remain in view. This small effect adds to the overall
          polish of the design and greatly improves user experience.

        <h3>Creating a minimal store, packed full of features</h3>
        <p>
          When browsing products, a viewer is greeted with a traditional grid of
          options. From here, the viewer can mouse over any of the links and
          quickly view the product.
        </p>
        <h3>A bold product page.</h3>
        <p>
          When viewing a single product page, the viewer is greeted with a very
          unique design. Typically, the product images are along the left or the
          right, however, we decided to go a different route. We put the photo
          front and center, and then pinned the ability to add the product to
          cart to the top right corner of the screen.

        <h3>More features</h3>
        <p>
          This project is packed full of features and we barely even touched the
          surface. If you like what you see and you want us to help with your
          next website let us know and we can discuss even more of the features
          we built into this project
        </p>
        <h3>Could you be next?</h3>
        <p>
          We are always looking for more forward thinking clients. Bee allowed
          us the creative freedom necessary to make all of the features that
          they wanted possible. We had a blast working with them and developing
          this website. If you want your business to have a website that stands
          out, let us know! We would love to see how we can help.
